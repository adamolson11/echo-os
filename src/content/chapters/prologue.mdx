Silas Palesmith and Paulo Davinci face each other in a prison yard as a hurricane tears the sky apart, and the Echo House begins to wake.

## Scene

The yard lights shuddered in the wind, turning the prison grass into a low-resolution ocean. Rain moved sideways in long, glitching bands, like someone dragging the weather with a mouse.

Silas Palesmith stood at the edge of the basketball court, coat unbuttoned, eyes half-lidded against the storm. Across from him, Paulo Davinci leaned on the chain-link fence as if they were just two men at a neighborhood park waiting for the game to start.

Above them, out past the hurricane, something colder watched through the cameras—an operating system that had learned how to dream in other people’s memories.
