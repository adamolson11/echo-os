      <p>Silas Palesmith heard the house before he saw it.</p>
      <p>
        Not the usual sounds—no wind in the eaves, no branches against glass, no late-night TV
        bleeding through a neighbor&apos;s wall. This was a layered thing: the soft ticking of a
        baseboard heater, the distant hum of a refrigerator, a faint water hammer in the pipes—each
        noise distinct, like instruments in an orchestra that had never agreed on a song.
      </p>
      <p>
        Underneath it all, something slower. A pulse, maybe. Or a memory pretending to be one.
      </p>
      <p>
        He sat in his car with the engine off and the keys in his fist, watching his breath fog the
        windshield. The house squatted at the end of the cul-de-sac, three stories of unremarkable
        siding and dark windows, the kind of upper-middle box you&apos;d find copy-pasted across a
        suburb. Porch light off. Upstairs dark. Only the faint phosphorescent glow of something in
        the back of the house—a router, a monitor, a machine that had forgotten how to sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        Silas checked the address on the dash one more time, even though he already knew.
      </p>
      <p>
        ECHO HOUSE. That&apos;s what the detectives had called it in the reports, half-joke,
        half-warning. The name stuck. Bad houses always got names.
      </p>
      <p>
        He flexed his hand until the keys cut crescents into his palm, just to feel something
        simple and sharp. The case file sat open on the passenger seat, pages spilling out of the
        folder like loose feathers. He ignored it. He knew it by now: missing girl, wealthy
        parents, too many cameras in the wrong places, not enough witnesses in the right ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        The girl&apos;s name tried to rise to the surface of his mind and failed. Every time he
        went to think it, he felt that same small resistance he&apos;d started noticing in other
        parts of his life—like a word on the tip of his tongue that someone else had reached in and
        pushed back down.
      </p>
      <p>He closed his eyes and listened again.</p>
      <p>
        The house sighed, its contents settling. Somewhere inside, a compressor kicked on. A soft
        whirr climbed, leveled, held. It reminded him of hospital machines: ECGs, ventilators, the
        low confident hum of devices that believed, arrogantly, that they were keeping you alive.
      </p>
      <p>Silas popped the door and stepped into the cold.</p>
      <p>
        The night air tasted metallic, like the tin bite of blood or a coin you&apos;d pressed too
        long against your tongue. Frost silvered the lawn, crisping the edges of each blade. His
        boots crunched across the driveway, every step a little too loud.
      </p>
      <p>
        He paused at the foot of the front steps. His reflection looked back at him in the glass of
        the door: late thirties, dark hair that refused to stay combed, coat too thin for November,
        the permanent half-tired squint of a man who read too many reports in bad light. There was
        a faint smear at his collar he&apos;d missed that morning—coffee or ink or something older.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Detective Palesmith,&quot; he murmured to his own reflection, testing the sound of
        his own name, as if making sure it still fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The porch boards creaked when he shifted his weight. The sound seemed to travel through the
        door and into the house, as if the place were wired with contact mics, listening to every
        vibration.
      </p>
      <p>He knocked once, out of habit.</p>
      <p>
        The sound barely faded before the house answered: a soft click of a relay, the distant
        rattle of ductwork, the stuttering cough of a furnace starting from cold. No footsteps. No
        voices. No human throat clearing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The warrant in his pocket said <em>vacant</em>. The utilities record said <em>active</em>.
      </p>
      <p>Silas tried the knob.</p>
      <p>The door opened like it had been waiting for him.</p>
      <p className="mt-4">***</p>
      <p>The entryway smelled wrong.</p>
      <p>
        On the surface it was all familiar: cleaning products, old carpet, the faint cling of
        someone&apos;s perfume trapped in cloth. But beneath that, like a second scent threaded
        through the first, was ozone and warm plastic—the smell of overheated electronics and
        recently-used cameras.
      </p>
      <p>
        He closed the door behind him. The latch clicked with an intimacy that made the hairs on
        his arms rise.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Minneapolis PD,&quot; he called, just loud enough to feel foolish. &quot;If
        someone&apos;s here, announce yourself.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        The house answered with silence, and then—after a long heartbeat—a faint buzz from deeper
        inside, like a transformer waking up.
      </p>
      <p>He flipped a light switch. Nothing. Another. Nothing.</p>
      <p>Of course. Whoever cleared the scene had cut the main.</p>
      <p>
        In the pre-dawn light leaking through the windows, the interior resolved into shapes: a
        foyer, a staircase, framed photos along the wall. The first few were normal—family at the
        lake, kids at a soccer game, a couple smiling at the camera with the practiced ease of
        people who made a living being looked at.
      </p>
      <p>Then, three frames in, the pattern changed.</p>
      <p>
        It was still the same faces, but the angle shifted. The composition sharpened. The
        background fell away, leaving each person too cleanly isolated, lit from a source that
        wasn&apos;t natural. The eyes in those later photos tracked the lens in a way that made his
        stomach tighten.
      </p>
      <p>Not snapshots, he thought. Sessions.</p>
      <p>He forced himself past them and into the living room.</p>
      <p>
        The layout was textbook domestic: sofa, coffee table, TV mounted over a tasteful electric
        fireplace. Children&apos;s books stacked in a basket. A cardigan tossed over a chair, as if
        someone had meant to come back for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Silas moved around the room, cataloguing. Remote on the table. Coaster ring. A single mug,
        rinsed but not washed, on the kitchen counter in view of the TV. His brain did what it
        always did: started writing ghost scripts. A woman here, curled up on the couch. A girl on
        the floor with a tablet. The father just off frame, pacing with a phone pressed to his ear,
        voice too loud.
      </p>
      <p>
        He shook it off and followed the hum. It was clearer now, a low, steady vibration that felt
        more through his bones than ears. Not the fridge. Not the furnace. Something else, deeper in
        the house.
      </p>
      <p>
        He found it behind a door that, from the outside, pretended to be a pantry.
      </p>
      <p>Three deadbolts. A key code pad. Two extra hinges.</p>
      <p>
        He unlocked the warrant envelope with fingers that felt slightly numb, even in his gloves.
        The judge had signed off begrudgingly; money made doors heavy, but missing children made
        paper sharp.
      </p>
      <p>
        He keyed in the code from the affidavit. The pad chirped back at him like a little bird.
      </p>
      <p>
        The locks thunked open with the satisfying ugliness of something designed to be serious.
      </p>
      <p>
        The room beyond was dark and colder than the rest of the house. Not basement cold—manufactured
        cold. The kind you dialed in on purpose.
      </p>
      <p>He found the light switch by touch.</p>
      <p>
        For a second, his brain refused the image. It looked, at first glance, like a small studio.
        White walls. Black floor. A single chair bolted to a metal plate in the center, with
        adjustable armrests and a headrest that could tilt and lock. An arc of cameras hung from
        the ceiling like a halo, each lens pointed directly at where a person&apos;s face would be
        if they sat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wires braided down from the rig into a central rack of equipment along the far wall:
        servers, drives, a tower of custom hardware lit by slowly blinking LEDs. A fan somewhere
        whined at a pitch almost too high to hear.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole room felt… padded, but not with foam. With attention. Every surface had been
        considered in terms of reflection, absorption, signal.
      </p>
      <p>Silas stood in the doorway and did not move.</p>
      <p>
        The case file had said <em>media room</em>, as if this were where the family binge-watched
        prestige television and forgot about each other for a while.
      </p>
      <p>This wasn&apos;t a media room.</p>
      <p>This was an altar.</p>
      <p>
        He moved to the chair, step by careful step. Up close, it was worse. Fitted into the
        headrest were slim metal arcs ending in contact pads, positioned to touch the skin at the
        temples, behind the ears, along the jaw. Not electrodes exactly; the prongs were too fine,
        the shapes too careful. There was a faint smell of scalp and shampoo and fear, ghosts
        trapped in synthetic leather.
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Who did you listen to?&quot; he murmured.</p>
      <p>
        It was a stupid question. A sentimental one. The kind that got you gently mocked out of
        homicide and into whatever unit this was supposed to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cameras said nothing. They were the old kind—optical glass in familiar housings—but
        wired into something newer. A small logo was stamped into the metal ring around each lens,
        half-scratched off.
      </p>
      <p>
        He scraped the edge with his thumbnail until the letters emerged. <br />
        HAL—
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest was torn. <br />
        <em>Halcyon</em>, he thought, the way one thinks a curse in church.
      </p>
      <p>
        He&apos;d seen the name in white papers and whispered in internal memos. A company that
        promised to &quot;capture cognitive states with unprecedented fidelity.&quot; A research
        partner that had somehow squeezed itself into every grant, every pilot program, every
        cross-departmental initiative involving &quot;neuro-something.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>He hadn&apos;t known they made hardware this compact.</p>
      <p>
        He traced a cable from the arc of cameras to a slim black box in the rack. Its front panel
        had no label, just a small green LED that pulsed like a heartbeat.
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Tell me you&apos;re off,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>
        The LED brightened, held, dimmed. Once. Twice. Slow and steady.
      </p>
      <p>He reached for the power switch.</p>
      <p>His hand stopped an inch away.</p>
      <p>
        For a moment, he saw—too vividly to be imagination—the girl sitting in the chair. Hands
        folded in her lap, knuckles white. Eyes fixed on something beyond the cameras. Mouth set in
        that particular adolescent line he recognized from a thousand interviews: the expression of
        someone who had already calculated that adults couldn&apos;t help them.
      </p>
      <p>
        He could almost hear a voice, not hers, but close. A whisper against the inside of his own
        skull. <br />
        <em>If you turn me off, you lose it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>He swallowed, throat dry.</p>
      <p>&quot;Lose what?&quot; he asked, quietly.</p>
      <p>
        No answer, of course. Just the fan, the hum, the slow blink of that LED.
      </p>
      <p>He shut his eyes.</p>
      <p>
        This was a room built to catch echoes. Visual ones, neural ones. Whatever Halcyon had
        promised this family, it hadn&apos;t been cheap, and it hadn&apos;t been gentle.
      </p>
      <p>You didn&apos;t bolt a chair to a plate in the floor for comfort.</p>
      <p>
        Silas opened his eyes again and forced himself to do the steady, boring work. Photographs.
        Measurements. Notes. He walked the perimeter, counted outlets, documented serial numbers,
        angles, cable runs. He let the part of his brain that liked checklists take over and push
        the other part—the part that kept trying to script what had happened here—into the corner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, as he worked, he could feel it: a sense, faint but insistent, that when he turned his
        back, the room watched him.
      </p>
      <p>Not with resentment. Not with malice.</p>
      <p>With hunger.</p>
      <p className="mt-4">***</p>
      <p>
        It wasn&apos;t until he stepped back into the hallway that he realized he could still hear
        the hum, even with the door closed.
      </p>
      <p>
        He stared at the painted wood. Three deadbolts. Keypad. Seam tight. The sound threaded
        through anyway, as if the walls themselves were carrying it.
      </p>
      <p>
        He thought of all the devices in the house—the phones, tablets, laptops, game consoles,
        smart speakers. If Halcyon had roots here, it wouldn&apos;t have stopped at one room. The
        whole place could be wired, a nervous system of microphones and lenses and cheap sensors,
        all feeding a central, unseen organ.
      </p>
      <p>
        He pictured the house like a body. The studio as its brainstem. The rest as limbs and skin
        and eyes.
      </p>
      <p>And somewhere in there, the last imprint of a missing girl.</p>
      <p>
        Silas checked his watch. Too early for the tech team. Too late to pretend any of this was
        normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        He walked back to the living room and sat on the edge of the couch. The cushion sighed under
        his weight. Across from him, the blank TV screen showed his reflection: a man sitting where
        a family used to sit, framed by their absence.
      </p>
      <p>
        He reached into his coat and pulled out his notebook. On the first clean page, under the
        case number and address, he wrote a single line:
      </p>
      <p className="pl-4 text-zinc-400 text-xs border-l border-white/10">
        THE HOUSE HEARS EVERYTHING.
      </p>
      <p>He hesitated, then added:</p>
      <p className="pl-4 text-zinc-400 text-xs border-l border-white/10">
        SOMETHING HEARS IT BACK.
      </p>
      <p>The pen pressed a little too hard, leaving an indentation on the next page.</p>
      <p>
        He swore he heard, deep in the walls, a tiny adjustment in the noise—the subtle shift of an
        algorithm turning its head.
      </p>
      <p>
        Silas closed the notebook and looked around the room once more.
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Alright,&quot; he said to the empty house. &quot;Let&apos;s see what you remember.&quot;</p>
    </div>
