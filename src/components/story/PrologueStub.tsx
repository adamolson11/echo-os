        The storm had been chewing on the Gulf for three days before it
        remembered Adam Palesmith. By the time the bands rolled over Pinellas,
        the sky looked less like weather and more like a terminal screen full of
        errors, green lightning for slashes, thunder for the enter key. The
        house on Hudson Street took every hit in silence, its windows dark,
        its Wi‑Fi light blinking like a pulse that refused to flatline.

        Silas sat on the edge of the ruined couch in his father&apos;s old field
        jacket, soaking in the glow of a television that wasn&apos;t actually on.
        The screen showed the static of his own mind: every mistake, every
        missed call, every version of himself he&apos;d tried to overwrite. Somewhere
        beneath the floorboards, the Dream Camera hummed in standby, a sleeping
        animal that never stopped recording. He could feel it in his molars, in
        the thin metallic burn behind his eyes whenever he blinked too long.

        Outside, sirens rose and fell, warbling through the wind like they were
        underwater. The city had turned into a wet circuit board: flooded
        streets, blown transformers, palm trees bent into question marks. His
        phone vibrated on the coffee table with another weather alert, another
        debt collector, another message from a life he wasn&apos;t living. Silas let
        it buzz until the screen dimmed. The only notification that mattered
        came from inside his skull — a cold, familiar pressure, the way the
        Echo OS announced it was ready to boot.

        Somewhere between one blink and the next, the house exhaled. The walls
        stretched a few inches farther than physics allowed. The hallway to the
        bathroom became too long. The power went out, but the TV stayed on,
        bright and sharp, now showing a door he didn&apos;t own and a hallway he
        didn&apos;t recognize. The interface in his head whispered a single line of
        text across his vision: <span className="font-mono text-skyblue">NEW
        SESSION · ECHO HOUSE INSTANCE 01</span>.

        This is the prologue stub. The full chapter will replace this text as we
        draft the novel, but the shell you&apos;re reading in now is the same
        reading mode the finished book will use.
